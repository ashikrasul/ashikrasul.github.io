title: "Stabilizing and Balancing of Linear and Rotary Inverted Pendulum System"

excerpt: 'We modeled different inverted pendulums as linear systems and designed different controllers to stabilize them. We analyzed three prototypes for this thesis: a cart-pole system, a self-balancing robot, and a Quanser rotary inverted pendulum. We obtained transfer functions and state-space models of the systems and designed PID controllers with Ziegler-Nichols method. For the rotary inverted pendulum, we applied both pole placement and an LQR controller.'
