I am **Ashik Rasul**, a Graduate Researcher at Tennessee Tech University.
My work focuses on **UAV autonomy, POMDP exploration, and battery SOC estimation**.

Previously, I worked in manufacturing automation (Unilever), and currently I work on
probabilistic decision-making frameworks for autonomous VTOL landing.
